Break the challenge down into larger ("macro") steps first. See the file `js/index.js` for extensive notes on this problem and tips to approach getting things started.

## To start
1. Fork
2. Clone the fork
3. Work! (See `index.js` for tips)
4. Bring the project to our next class as complete as possible with clearly identified macro and micro steps
